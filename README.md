To run the program the user just need to run caveroute <file> on the command line, and the program executes reading in <file>.cav
and outputting <file>.csn and the time taken is displayed.. Eg. caveroute generated100-1.cav. 

The file will produce a file with the path to follow. In case there is not route, an appropiate message will be printed in the output file.
